**Tasks**

0. Change comes from within (mandatory)

Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

- Prototype: `def makeChange(coins, total)`
- Return: Fewest number of coins needed to meet the total
- If the total is 0 or less, return 0
- If the total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
- `coins` is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
- The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
- You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
- Your solution's runtime will be evaluated in this task

Example usage:
```python
makeChange = __import__('0-making_change').makeChange

print(makeChange([1, 2, 25], 37))
print(makeChange([1256, 54, 48, 16, 102], 1453))
```

Expected output:
```
7
-1
```
